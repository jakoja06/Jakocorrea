# Blueprints & Schematics

Place your PDF drawings and technical documents here.

To add a blueprint to a project, update the `assets` object in `data.js`:

```javascript
assets: {
  blueprints: [
    { title: "Assembly View", url: "./assets/blueprints/assembly.pdf", type: "PDF", size: "2 MB" }
  ]
}
```
