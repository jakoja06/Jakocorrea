# main links
main:
  - title: "Home"
    # This will now correctly resolve to /Jakocorrea/
    url: /
  - title: "About"
    # This link is relative and should use the baseurl prefix
    url: /about/
  - title: "Portfolio"
    # ***CRITICAL FIX: Use the full repository path in the URL***
    url: /Jakocorrea/portfolio/ 
  - title: "Resume"
    # Ensure resume also uses the full path
    url: /Jakocorrea/resume/
